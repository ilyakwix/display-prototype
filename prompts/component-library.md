# Component Library

## Usage Guide

- Use Radix themes as the basic building blocks for UI components.
- If a component does not exist, create it in `/app/components/` and ensure it is reusable across the application.
- Always use CSS Modules for styling components, following the naming convention `component-name.module.css`.
- Use Radix-UI components where appropriate for accessibility and functionality.
- Don't style radix components unless explicitly asked for. Use existing Radix props to customize components
- This is the documentation for radix themes: https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/overview/getting-started
