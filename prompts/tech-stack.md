# Tech Stack

React 19, TypeScript, CSS Modules, **React Router v7 only** (do not use any other versions), OpenProps, React Hook Form, Radix-UI, lucide-react, Recharts.

## CSS Modules

- Any time you add or modify a CSS-Module or global style file, you **must** import it in the associated component (or in your root entry) so it actually takes effect.

## Lucide React Icons

- Before importing an icon, verify it's a named export of `lucide-react`. If it isn't, fallback to the 'square' icon.

## Forbidden & Read-Only Files

1. READ-ONLY (Context Only)
    The content of certain files may be provided for informational purposes. You must not edit them directly.
    Example of such file might be `package.json`. If this file is provided you can see which packages and scripts are available. To add a dependency, you must use the appropriate tool.

2. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN (NO ACCESS)
    You must never read or modify the following files and directories under any circumstances:
        - `.gitignore`
        - `package-lock.json`
        - `tsconfig.json`
        - `react-router.config.ts`
